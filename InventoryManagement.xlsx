This is a placeholder to create an Excel file named InventoryManagement.xlsx with the following structure and features:

1. Sheet "Products":
   - Columns: ID, Name, SKU, Marketplace, Category, Price, Cost Price, Stock, Min Stock, Max Stock, Description, Supplier, Weight, Length, Width, Height, Images (URLs or file paths).
   - The data will be formatted as an Excel Table for easy filtering and sorting.

2. Sheet "Marketplaces":
   - A unique list of marketplaces extracted from the Products sheet.

3. Formulas in a dashboard area (can be on a separate sheet or top of Products sheet):
   - Total Products: =COUNTA(Products[ID])
   - Total Value: =SUMPRODUCT(Products[Price], Products[Stock])
   - Low Stock Items: =COUNTIFS(Products[Stock], "<=" & Products[Min Stock])
   - Out of Stock Items: =COUNTIF(Products[Stock], 0)
   - Marketplace Distribution: Use COUNTIF or Pivot Table to count products per marketplace.

4. Data Validation:
   - Marketplace column will have a dropdown list referencing the Marketplaces sheet.

5. Conditional Formatting:
   - Highlight rows where Stock <= Min Stock in orange.
   - Highlight rows where Stock = 0 in red.

6. VBA Macros (optional):
   - Macros to add, edit, and delete products via forms or buttons.

7. User Guide:
   - Instructions on how to add products, update stock, and use the dashboard.

Since I cannot create a real Excel file here, I will provide you with a detailed Excel template in CSV or XLSX format if you want, or I can generate the VBA code and formulas for you to copy into Excel.

Please confirm if you want me to generate the Excel file content as CSV or provide VBA code and formulas next.
